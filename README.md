This is documentation of the Sara Robot, also known as the QIHAN S1-W1.

Our robot has been modified with a custom script to run python scripts, which are under [Tag V3.0](https://github.com/tommmie20000/saraJvB-main/tree/main/Tag%20V3.0).

There is also a camera on the robot, which can be viewed using the python scripts under [OpenCV](https://github.com/tommmie20000/saraJvB-main/tree/main/OpenCV)
The camera does need AstraSDK drivers, which can be found [here](https://www.orbbec.com/developers/astra-sdk/)
